Revision history for Tk-ROSyntaxText

1.000   10-Aug-2010
        Initial release.

1.001   11-Aug-2010
        No changes to module code (except for the version number).

        Changes required to most regression tests (t/*.t) to stop incorrect
        reports from automated testing software that the module doesn't build.
        The reason for the incorrect reports is documented on the CPAN
        Testers Wiki (http://wiki.cpantesters.org/wiki/CPANAuthorNotes) under
        the heading:
        "Why are you testing (and failing) my Tk-ish module without an X server?"
